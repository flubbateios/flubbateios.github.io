This bit of the guide is if you have just got the game or you are not experienced.<br>

<br />
I don't recommend jumping straight into multi planet games. Try playing single planet to get an understanding of your economy and once you fully understand how you should go about expanding your economy and expanding your armies you should then play multi planet games. Although Pax games are fun (especially when they run at 12% sim speed), you should not base your strategies off your experiences in those games until you know what you are doing. Instead, try 1v1 ranked or play custom team games. If you lose 1v1 ranked, try to get advice from your opponent, especially if they are significantly higher than you in the ladder. Do not be scared to lose your rank. Galactic war is also not a good idea. It limits the units you can build and messes around with your economy and will not help you when making builds for competitive use.
