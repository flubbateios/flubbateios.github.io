<h1>Using your units correctly & Unit Composition</h1>

<h2>Types of Units</h2>
In PA there are four types of units. Air, Vehicle, Bot and Naval. I'm not going to include orbital in this section. If you want to use orbital in 1v1, you should be experienced enough to not need this guide.
<br />
Air is somewhat expensive and fragile but it is very fast. It is easily countered with anti air turrets and spinners/storms.
<br />
Vehicles are units that are slower than bots but faster than naval. They tend to be more expensive than bots but they deal greater damage and have more HP.
<br />
Bots are faster than vehicles, slower than air, and cheaper than vehicles. They are cheap, expendable units that don't do much damage compared to tanks.<br />
Naval units are the most expensive type of units however they deal a lot of damage to other units and have a lot of HP. With the exception of the Kaiju, they are restricted to the sea. They are very powerful if you can get them into a place where they can shoot at the opponent.
<br />
<h2>Using your units effectively</h2>

<h3>Air</h3>
Air is an incredibly important part of PA. If you have air control, you are able to start building bombers, which can damage land units. Bombers are fantastic against fast raiding parties consisting of only bots since there is no good AA bot. Bombers are also fantastic at sniping fabbers. This is especially annoying for the opponent early-game. It is important to keep your air together unless you are using it for scouting. This is because air units are very fast and the opponent can pick off your small parties of planes with their air force that is grouped up even if it is smaller than your entire air force. When attacking, you don't really need to split up your air since it is so mobile. If you have air control, you want to pressure your opponent with your air. Start building bombers, scout for parties that don't have any spinners (eg. raiding dox) and bomb them. You can also scout for expanding fabbers and kill them. This will force your opponent to invest heavily into anti air which will slow down their expansion. You can take advantage of their inability to expand and raid by expanding very fast with bot fabricators or air fabricators and then using this extra metal for land units. Air control also means you do not have to build any anti air whatsoever (as long as you maintain air control).  
<br />
Air has its limitations in PA. Flak Cannons and Storms are incredibly powerful against air units and can destroy a lot of air very quickly (>100 planes). If your opponent has storms and flak, you should not try to destroy their army with air, instead, you will have to build land units. You will have to take advantage of mobility that you have due to your air and <strong>expand</strong> very quickly in order to have the metal for this. On small maps, there is not so much metal so you cannot use your air to expand as much therefore you should invest in land units more; spamming air will not be as effective. Having air control is therefore very important in PA but you must be careful not to build too much air, especially on small maps. I recommend building just enough air to prevent the opponent from building bombers on small maps.<br />

<strong>Note:Dox can shoot air but they are really bad at it. You should keep your air moving if you are above dox so they are unable to shoot your planes down. Do not leave your air over an opponent party of dox or it will die.</strong>
<br />

<h3>Tanks</h3>
In contrast to air, tanks do not provide much mobility and they cannot really be used for raiding. With tanks, you should generally keep them together while making a push but you can split them up when you are smashing stuff up. Tanks are good for attacking the base or important locations for the opponent. Bots are generally better at dealing with undefended expansion. In general they are good against bots. When you build tanks, you should push them up and take the metal behind them, which will enable you to build more tanks therefore destroy the base more quickly. In the very early game you shouldn't send tanks straight to the opponent's base because they can use their commander to kill the tanks.
<br />
<h3>Bots</h3>
Bots are units that are good at raiding in PA because of their speed and their price. They are inferior to tanks when making pushes into the opponent's base if the economies are similar. You should therefore use them to destroy the opponent's economy and boost your own. When using bots, you should try to attack from as many angles as possible and you should split them up. You should also try and send them to as many expansions as possible in order to snipe fabricators and destroy undefended expansions, as well as scout the opponent's expansion. You should avoid sending bots towards turrets or the commander because they are both very good at destroying bots. If you want to spam bots, you should attack the base once you have tier 2 bots. On bigger maps, you should use your air to scout for undefended expansions, and then send bots to destroy them. You should avoid putting tanks into bot raiding parties because the tanks will slow the bots down. In great numbers (and when you have t2 bots), you can start destroying turrets and attacking the main base. It is very hard to kill a commander with bots if you have no t2. You should remember that bots are very vulnerable to air, so having air control will greatly increase the effectiveness of you bots. Therefore, you should not continue spamming bots if you are behind on air. If you have air control, you should keep your air force nearby, ready for a trade if your opponent tries to bomb your  bots.
<br />
<h3>Naval</h3>
There are two ways that you will have to use naval: On land maps with some water, or on predominantly naval maps. On land maps, naval units are very effective against land units and structures. Air is not very effective against ships and even if there is no AA in the unit composition, the bombers will take quite a while. Once they get into a position where they can destroy things, they are hard to stop. Torpedo launchers work very well against tier 1 boats however they need to be in place before the opponent's naval arrives; it is difficult to build a torpedo launcher while naval units are attacking it. You should not go naval on maps where the ships will not get you much metal and will not do enough damage to the opponent; naval units are expensive and they will not be cost-effective. If you are the only one with naval, try and prevent the opponent from getting naval in the same body of water so that you can claim all of the economy in this body of water and keep investing into land units (instead of more naval to counter the opponent). Placing radar for this purpose can be very effective on maps like Clutch. You should then build ships that attack land and station them at places where they can do damage. If you are attacking land, you should try and split your ships up so they can attack more things at once.
<br />
Naval is obviously very important on naval maps. In the early game, you should avoid raiding expansions protected by torpedo launchers because you will just lose your boats and the opponent can use their boats to attack your base or attack unprotected expansion. On naval maps, you can split up your units and attack individual expansions but you should group them up when confronting a large force of ships. Even though naval units are really slow, you can still raid expansions because they will not have anything faster. Later into the game, you can start attacking expansions defended by torpedo launchers but you should ensure that you will have enough units to defend yourself.
<br />
<h2>Unit Composition</h2>
In PA, it is important to vary the units that you use since units can be countered therefore they are varied so that your army is very hard to counter with specific units.<br> 
<strong>Note: This is not a definitive guide on what units you should build. It is just a starting point that works well and can be good against top players.</strong><br>
<h3>Raiding parties</h3>
Raiding parties should consist of bots mainly. You should avoid grenadiers and sparks because they are slow. Dox and boom bots are generally the best for raiding. boom bots are too temporary therefore they are situational. If attacking undefended expansions, you should use only dox because you will get to keep them after destroying the metal. When attacking expansions defended with turrets, mixing in some boom bots is a good idea since they are effective against turrets. You should scout what you plan to raid first so you know what sort of units you should build. If you have tier 2, you can start raiding heavily defended expansions with slammers as well.<br />
<h3>Air Force</h3>
Your air force should consist mainly of fighters. You should not build icarus for use in combat unless you know what you're doing and it is part of a strategy. If you have enough fighters that you can successfully destroy the opponent's air force if engaged, then you can start building bombers. I don't recommend building bombers when you don't have air control. Although you can get away with a fabber snipe or two, it relies on the opponent failing to use their air correctly. With t2, kestrels and phoenix are the best units to build because they are the fastest. Hornets and Wyrms are situational and should not be used in normal circumstances.<br />
<h3>Tanks</h3>
When building tank forces to do damage to heavily defended areas or expansions, your force should consist predominantly of ants (until t2) since they have a good balance of range, health and damage towards land units. It is very important to include infernos in your unit composition because they have a lot of health so they can take hits from turrets or other units while your other tanks shoot at them. They also have a very high damage output and limited range. If you can get them into the middle of a base, they will do massive damage to buildings. If dox and other bots get too close, they will also get crushed by infernos. If you have air control, you should include very few or no spinners in your unit compositions. Although including no spinners would be the most metal-efficient thing to do, it is not easy to control your air force and your army, especially when pushing into an area with heavy air defence. If you have similar amounts of air, you should include a few spinners so you can avoid an air trade over the opponent's base which will probably have anti-air defences. Drifters are a situational unit and should only be used for traversing water or lava, they can be good for a surprise attack but they are not as cost-effective as ants.<br>
 Once you have tier 2 tanks, you should start building predominantly levelers. You should not really continue building tier 1 tanks since they are somewhat redundant at this stage; continue building t2 factories. Levelers are incredibly powerful units; they shred static defences and are very good against tier 2 bots and tier 1 tanks. If they end up in your base, they will likely destroy a very large part of it. With the remaining t1 factories, you should reduce numbers of ants and increase the numbers of infernos. This is because ants have massively inferior damage output to levelers and massively inferior health. Infernos are a better unit to build because they have lots of health and they can keep your levelers alive for even longer. They also have a good damage output and they are very good at dealing with dox and boombots, two units that levelers are weak to because they only fire once every second. Vanguards are not a great unit to build because they are very expensive compared to levelers (2.5x cost) and their range is very limited, and you already have t1 tank production for infernos, a cheaper and weaker alternative. Storms are a situational unit that you should build if the opponent's air force is incredibly large and you are unable to counter it. They do massive damage to air because their projectile does splash damage. This will protect you from incredibly large air forces if they do not have tier 2 air. You should not build more than one or two per army; building more would be pointless since you are already defended from large air forces. Shellers cost twice as much as levelers and should be used situationally. They are great at dealing with units like ants and dox from far away because of their splash damage but you should not build your army from mainly shellers because they have very little health. They also outrange pelters so if micro'd correctly, they will be useful if your opponent is turtling in one area. They also work well for weakening armies as they approach your base.<br>
 <h3>Bot Armies</h3>
Assuming you already have air control, your bot forces should consist of dox while you are stuck with tier 1 (attacking from every angle). Once you get tier 2 bots, you should start building slammers. Now, you can push straight into the base and destroy it. You should also build a few boom bots if your opponent is just spamming tanks.<br>
<strong>Note: Bot armies are a harder to use than tank armies; they require more micro. They are also weak to tanks so you should use them mainly for their mobility and their versatility as raiding units and offensive units.</strong><br>
<h3>Naval - Naval Maps</h3>
On naval maps, barracudas are generally the best unit to build since they are the most effective in naval to naval combat. They cannot be targeted by narwhals/piranhas and orcas lose to them in a 1vs1 situation. If you are ahead in naval production, building orcas can be a good idea to do damage to the little land on the map. Narwhals are good against air so if you are behind on air, building a few narwhals would help as well. With t2 naval, you should build leviathans or krakens. Both can be effective in their own ways; leviathans are good for destroying expansions from far away and dealing with torpedo launchers, and Krakens are good for causing massive damage from a short range. If the opponent has spammed many torpedo launchers, building kaijus can be effective as well because they cannot be targeted by torpedo launchers. You should not build too much tier 2 naval because barracudas are still the most effective unit in naval to naval combat (for the metal cost) therefore you should continue building tier 1 naval factories. <br>
<h3>Naval - Land maps with a bit of naval</h3>
If your opponent has not built any naval, you should not build submarines. Instead, build orcas and narwhals so you can start doing damage. You should then move onto tier 2 and start building kaijus and leviathans. Although these units are not as powerful on naval maps, they do a lot of damage to land units and are very difficult to get rid of. If they do have naval, then try and destroy it as quickly as possible by building barracudas then go back to building ships that attack land.
