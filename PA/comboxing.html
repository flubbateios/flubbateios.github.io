<h1>Comboxing</h1>
Comboxing is where you are so close to the enemy that your commmanders are
fighting each other.  Custom maps can be made to force this to happen
(usually a small lava planet with only one very small island) but it isn't
uncommon in regular games set on small planets. If you can get good at it
then you can often win games against people who are techinally better
players than you by forcing them to combox. Comboxing is even more common at
the moment due to the number of people using "True economy" or similar mods
which make the commander move faster and easier to repair. 
<br>
You can turn a game into a combox by attacking the enemy base with your
commander or positioning him in a place that makes it almost impossible for
your enemy to expand, forcing them to use their com to try to fight you off.
If they decide not to do that, then you have a huge advantage anyway because
you should be able to contain them and maybe even destroy some factories
with your com. To go the other way, if your enemy is trying to force you
into a combox then you really don't have an option other than to com box.
This makes comboxing a very useful skill even if you don't intend to use it
in your games because you never know when you will need to combox.
<br>
However, even on small maps, walking your commander to the enemy base would
take a very long time so when you eventually get there you would probably
find yourself in a fight you can't win as the enemy has many more units. To
stop this from happening there are a couple of options: pelican dropping a
combat fabber and using him to build a teleporter is a pretty safe way to
go, but will often be scouted and countered by most good players. The other
option is something called com-pushing, this is where you push your
commander with some faster units so that the commander can walk at the same
speed as those faster units - normally boombots or dox.
<br> 
<h2>Units, and getting them</h2>
There are some units that wouldn't normally be any good in regular games
which become very effective when you are comboxing, grenadiers are now
viable due to the fact that they can shoot over walls and have enough range
to work well against turrets, they can be especially effective when
combined with infernos. This can be very useful against turrets - the
infernos tank the damage of the turrets while the grenadiers use their range
and ability to shoot over walls to destroy the turrets. Because of how weak
most units are to the commander, a high apm is more much more important when
comboxing than in regular games. You always have to make sure that your
units are out of range of the enemies uber cannon, keep them behind your
walls/higer hp units, and make sure that they are targeting the correct
enemy unit. Avoiding uber cannons is <strong>incredibly</strong> important
as you will rarely have many units so a single well placed uber cannon could
destroy your entire army. 
<br>
Boom bots can be very useful in when comboxing, but as is always the case
when using boom bots, they are very easy to counter so it is essential that
you keep them hidden until the last possible moment. This is usually quite
easy because people rarely build air factories when comboxing so as long as
you keep all of their ground units away. If they do manage to scout your
boom bots then you should probably start building some more useful units
instead. It's also a good idea to remember that if your enemy has a radar
then they can probably tell if you are building boom bots due to the amount
 of them and how fast they can move. If you are sucessful in getting enough
boom bots to kill the enemy com (~40) then don't forget to use your own com
to destroy any turrets/dox/infernos before sending in the boom bots.
<br>
The need for vast amounts of early game units would likely make you want to
combat-fab reclaim, but obviously this wouldn't be a good idea when you
intend to use your com to fight the enemy. Instead, it is a good idea to
build very few or no fabricators. This allows you to build more factories
before building any energy plants, meaning you can start producing units
quicker. If you don't build any fabricators - which is a good idea on the
very smallest maps - then you can build 3 or sometimes 4 factories before
needing to build an energy plant. If you then later decide that you want to
build some fabricators then you need to remeber to build the subtible amount
of energy plants for them. A fabricator can be very useful as it means that
you can build t2 turrets and pelters - which can be very useful for
destroying enemy turrets without taking any losses. The main weakness of
pelters is there low hp which means they are easily killed by bombers or
other pelters. If you are already ahead, pelters can be a way of dealing
with your opponent without really taking any losses which could be useful if
you are playing in a FFA. I normally wouldn't use them in a regular 1v1
because they are quite expensive to build and very easy to kill. However,
if you have already set up enough defenses that you are confident the enemy
wouldn't be able to get any units through, and your opponent has done the
same, then they can be very useful and breaking that stalemate. If you are
in this situation a radar is very important (as always with long range
weapons) but you should also be scouting them so that you know when and
where they are building their own pelters allowing you to use your pelters
to kill their's before they are even finished building them. Once you know
that the pelter isn't going to be built, you should target fabricators so
they can't start to build any more, and then start to target their defenses
allowing you to use your units for something useful. 
<br>
One thing that you should remeber about using pelters when comboxing is that
if you want the person you are against to still be your friend after the
game then don't use them.
<br>
<h2>Counters and counter-counters</h2>
If your opponents scouts your com running up the middle of the map directly
at their base before he gets there then the have a huge advantage because at
this point they know that you haven't been building anything with your
commander in the last few seconds and they also know that you intend to
combox, which allows them to adjust their unit composition accordingly. Most
players, if they see a com being very aggressive, will start to build boom
bots almost straight away to try to get an easy kill. This means if you know
they are aware of your plan then you need to start building units that can
counter boom bots. If you are confident in your micro then infernos might be
good enough (but your have to be sure that you can always keep a decent
number of them right next to your com) if not, then you need to start
building dox. If you have already been building boom bots and your opponent
has scouted that then you should probably switch to grenadiers - you know
that the enemy is going to be building dox to counter your boom bots so you
build grenadiers as they can beat dox when there are walls involved. They
also have the range advantage which means if the dox want to attack your
grenadiers then they will have to move past their walls and therefore become
vunerable to your uber-cannon.
<br>
<h2>When to com box</h2>
Forcing your enemy into a combox can be a great way to sneak out a win that
you might not otherwise have got but it can also be very risky, even when
you win you will nearly always be very close to losing. This means that you
need to be incredibly careful about which games you chose to combox in. If
you pick the wrong game - for instance, if you try it on a map that is too
big - the enemy will be too far ahead by the time you start the combox so
you will likely lose. It is often hard to make this decision because for it
to be effective you need to decide that you are going to combox at the very
start of the game - often without time to scout - this means you often need
to decide before you have any idea what the enemy has been building. This
means you need to make that decision based only on the map and who you are
against. In terms of maps, "forge" is perfect, not only due to the size but
also due to the fact that half the map is lava which means that if you are
agressive enough with your com then the enemy will have absolutely nowhere
to go (to build factories or mex.) 
<br>
As for the player, if you are going against someone you think you should be
able to beat then it probably isn't a good idea to risk comboxing, so you
should normally only try it against players that are better than you.
<br>
<h3>Other tips</h3>
Take extra care to keep all of your units behind walls - this means, you
need to be very careful with attack commands because if you tell a unit to
attack an enemy unit it will follow that unit until it is dead. To stop
this, give the unit an attack command and once it has started attacking give
it a move command to where it already is - it will continue attacking the
unit you told it to but if that unit moves out of range it will stay in the
same place and chose another target.
<br>
If you are attacking a single target (eg commander attacking commander) then
using the uber cannon actually gives you lower dps - use it to kill groups
of units or weaken walls but if it isn't going to hit more than one thing
you are better off not using it.
<br>
Your commander can repair things very quickly. Having an idle com is often a
problem when comboxing because you can't really do much due to lack of space
and not being able to move your commmander very far. Even if that weren't
the case, it would still be a good idea to use your commander to repair
anything that is being damaged. This is especialy effective when used on
walls - if you have enough metal and energy income then repairing a wall can
make it survive significantly longer. Which can be much better than waiting
until the wall dies and then bulding another one.
