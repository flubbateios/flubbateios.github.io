<h1>Mods!</h1>

Mods in Planetary Annihilation are pretty much essential for success. Pretty much all good players use at least a few mods.
<br>
There are two different types of mods: Server mods and Client mods.
<br>
Server mods tend to change or add units to the game whereas client mods tend to make changes or add to the UI as well as making tweaks to the game (For instance, setting all factories to continuous build by default). Server mods are not allowed in tournaments unless explicitly stated. Installing client mods is <strong>not</strong> cheating. There are server mods that enable cheats though, however you will not be able to use them if you are not the lobby host or if you are playing 1v1 ranked. I am not going to recommend server mods since they cannot be used in ranked/tournaments.

<h2>How to install mods</h2>
<br>
Previously, we had to use PAMM to install mods but thanks to mikeyh and other fantastic people, we now have the Community Mods Manager which is in-game.
<br>
The Community Mods Manager can be accessed here!

<br>
Installing the mods can be done by going to the available tab and clicking install on the mod that you choose.

After installation, you can also enable and disable these mods without uninstalling.

<h2>Essential Mods</h2>
These mods can be found on the recommended tab.
<br>
<h3>#1 : PA Stats Online</h3>
This uploads stats about your games to <a href="http://pastats.com">a website called PA Stats</a>. This is a required mod for tournaments. There will be a checkbox when you are in the landing part of games where you can enable and disable PA Stats.
<br>
<h3>#2 : PA Chat for Titans & Classic</h3>
This mod adds chatrooms into the game. You can join the default chatroom by clicking this button <br />

This is a requirement for tournaments.
<br />
<h3>#3 : System Sharing for Titans & Classic</h3>
Allows you to install map packs and share systems with other people.<br />
This is also a requirement for tournaments<br />

<h2>Map packs</h2>

Map packs are collections of maps that you can play on if you host a game<br />
Here are some map packs you should get:<br />
AndreasG 1v1<br />
Exodus Esports Tournament mappack (useful/required for tournaments)<br />
WPMarshall's map pack<br />
Alpha2546 Map Pack<br />
Pwn4Two's Map Pack<br />

<h2>Very important mods</h2>

Here are some mods that you definitely should get but they are not essential:<br />
Infinite build - Sets all of your factories to continuous build mode by default<br />
Hotbuild2 - Adds hotkeys for building structures and units. This mod is very important indeed and you should have it<br />

<h2>Other helpful stuff</h2>

Less important mods that you can live without:<br />
Cover the line - You can make units go into a custom formation<br />
More Pew Pew - Improves projectile visibility <br />
Soft Landing - Removes most of the dust from the com landing so that you can start your build quicker.<br />
Favorite color - Because you <strong>need</strong> to have your favorite color in lobbies.<br />
combat fabricator group deselect - Stops you from selecting stitches with your army<br />
Eco manager - Turn off all factories/fabbers at once with a convenient button<br />
Mines as strips - Lets you build mines in lines instead of circles.<br />

<h2>Using Hotbuild2 (Hotkeys mod)</h2>
Using hotbuild will greatly increase the speed at which you can queue things in PA.<br />
