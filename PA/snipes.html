<h1>Snipes</h1>
-the act of winning the game in what would be called a "cancerous" manner.<br>
-Killing the commander by targeting him specifically with units that would be unable to destroy the rest of the base<br>
<h2>Options available</h2>
Is the game good as lost? Don't give up just yet, here are a few ways you
could steal out a win that you really don't deserve:
<br /> <h3>-Bombers</h3>
It takes exactly 22 bombers to kill a commander from 100% if there is no AA other than the
commanders, but doing this takes a good few runs and not an insignificant amount of time which means
if the enemy has any fighters at all then they will probably be used. For this reason and the fact
that there being absolutely no AA around the com is very unlikely,it is normally better to go for an
amount of bombers that can kill him in 1-2 bombing runs. This would be closer to ~40. However, with
combat-fab reclaiming your own commander currently in the meta, bomber sniping (and all sniping) is
much more effective. If the enemny commander is already on 50% without you even doing anything then
~20 bombers might me more than enough. There are a couple of ways you can go about getting that many
bombers, if you have a t2 fabber at your disposal then you can easily get out 10 air factories in no
time. Once you have got enough, give the fabricator a patrol command that includes 3 or 4 of the air
facs. This will get that fabricator to assist them all, why would you want to do that? Because if
you have a fabber assiting one factory then the time where one unit is leaving the factory and the
next one hasn't started to be built yet would be wasted. If you don't have t2 and the game is all
but lost, don't give up just yet - around 4 air factories being assisted by a commander and a fabber
can get to 20 bombers faster than you would think.  
<br /> <strong>The single most important
thing when you are attempting a bomber snipe is to make sure that your bombers and
air factories building bombers don't get scouted, if they do, your enemy can build a
single galata turret and instantly double the amount of bombers you are going to
need.</strong>
<br /> <h3>-Boom Bots</h3>
Boom bots can be very effective as a unit not just for
snipes (they are great at taking out levelers) but they are also very good at killing commanders and
are particuly effective on small maps. The only things you really need to know about boom bots is
that it takes 25 of them to kill a commander if the enemy doesn't use his uber cannon (this can be
achieved by sending in a group of units first to bait out the uber cannon), and that <strong> you
shouldn't send them into dox or turrets</strong> if the enemy has dox or turrets, using your
commander or other units to kill them before sending in the boom bots is a good idea.  
<br />
<h3>-SSX</h3>
The SSX was a very effective unit against not so good players back in classic PA when
you had to build a special radar to be able to see enemy orbital units but now that everyone can see
orbital units it is definitely much harder to pull off an ssx snipe, though not impossible.  <br />
It takes 12 SSX's to kill a commander in 1 shot, but if they don't have any anti-orbital (umbrella,
catapult) then 3 could easily do it. The hardest part of an ssx snipe is to build the ssx's without
your enemy noticing and find the commander. You can find the commander by sending one or two
advanced radar satellites to the enemy planet (may need more depending on how big the planet is.) As
for building the ssx without them noticing... this is a little harder, if they are a decent player
and are paying attention then you aren't going to manage it. There are a few things you can do to
increase your chances though - if you have a wide range of orbital units gathered around your
orbital factories then they might not notice an ssx in the middle, you should also try to have
enough orbital factories that you only have to build one ssx from each of them so that the enemy
only has one chance to notice.  <br /> Once you have enough and know where there commander is, make
sure that you send the ssx's to exactly where the commander is because they will sometimes waste
their first shot on some other unit and are very slow moving.  <br />
 <h3>-Pelican drops (various
options)</h3> The pelican is a t1 air unit which can pick up units and drop them somewhere else. The
best option to snipe the enemy commander would be levelers, because they have lots of damage, hp,
and range. Range is important because you can move the pelicans in range of any AA as they will get
1 shot, this means you have to drop them a decent distance from the commander. Another effective
snipe option is to drop a couple of combat-fabs and get them to build a teleporter close to the
enemy base which you can send your army through. This is incredibly effective with units that have a
high dps such as infernos or slammers.  <br /> Pelicans are very useful not just for snipes but also
for gaining map control and very aggressive harassment, for instance, getting a teleporter up behind
your enemies base in the first few minutes and sending your commander through can really screw up
your enemies plans.  <br />
 <h3>-Unit cannons</h3> This is more of a late game strategy as unit
cannons require t2 and are very expensive to build. Similar to the SSX, unit cannons are very easily
countered (anti-orbital, point defenses around the com...etc) they don't, however, instantly alert
the enemy of them being built so can be very effective but you should try to get them on the first
try. Your unit cannons should only be building slammers and spinners (normally at around a 5:1 ratio
depending on how much air they have) because the slammers have incredible dps but are very weak to
air units. When attempting a unit cannon snipe you should scout the enemy commander (maybe with
orbital radar or t2 fighters) and then tell the unit cannon to attack somewhere outside of the
commanders AA range.  <br /> 
<h3>-Surprise superweapons</h3> 
Even if you technically shouldn't have
enough eco for it, building a halley or a couple of nukes can be very possible with enough fabbers
and prehaps some metal storage spam. Catalysts are a little more tricky as you always need five of
them and the enemy is alerted as soon as you start building the first one so if you are very far
behind then they should have no trouble countering it, though it can be possible on a very large
system where orbital units take a very long time to travel to the metal planet. You can also try
building lots of defenses (anti-nukes, umbrellas) before you start building the catalyst. Rushing a
catalyst doesn't really count as a snipe because if you have full control of a metal planet then you
can't be very far behind but I thought I would put this in here anyway.  
<br />
 
<h2>Countering them</h2>
<strong>SCOUT ALL THE TIME.</strong> Never get complacent because you feel like the game is already
won. You should always know how many of each factory your enemy has, where his units are, what units
he is building...etc. If you don't know what kind of snipe the enemy is going for then you have
absolutely no chance of countering it. If you do know, however, then everything can be countered:
<br>
<h4>Bombers</h4>
Give your air a patrol command over an area much bigger than your base so that you prevent them from
scouting your commmander and also give yourself more warning of where the bombers are coming from.
Get your commander and any spare fabricators to build galata turrets, make sure all of your air
factories are builing fighters (hummingbirds) not bombers (bumblebees.) Once you have made your
commander safe, try to make sure he won't be able to use his bombers for anything else useful -
don't send your units out without a large amount of spinners, storms, or fighters supporting them.
<br>
<h4>Boom bots</h4>
Boom bots are weak to any rapid fire unit so if you scout enemy bot factories building boom bots
then make sure your commmander is surrounded by dox, slammers, or infernos.
<br>
<h4>SSX</h4>
This is a little harder to counter, obviously you need to build anti orbital (umbrellas, orbital
fighters, catapults) but the SSX has enough health that it can normally fire at least once even if
the ground below it is covered in anti orbital. To stop your commander from being killed instantly,
wait until they have scouted your com and sent their SSX's and then move your commander. This should
mean that the first shots can't hit you so your anti orbital can deal with them before they can fire
the second shot.
<br>
<h4>Pelican drops</h4>
The key to stopping a pelican drop being effective is to know where it is going to happen, this can
be done with a radar, or with scouts positioned just outside the enemy base. Once you know where
they are going to be sent, try to kill them with fighters before they get to their destination.
<br>
<h4>Unit cannons</h4>
There are a couple of ways you can counter unit cannons because when they arrive at your planet they
go through three stages; first they are an orbital unit, then they are an air unit, then once they
land, they are a ground unit. So the best way to prevent a unit cannnon snipe is to have your
commander surrounded by umbrellas, flak cannons, turrets, and catapults. Catapults are particuly
effective because they target both orbital units and ground units. It would probably also be a good
idea to have some air units always patroling the entire planet so you know where they land and can
deal with them quickly.

<h4>Surprise super weapons</h4>
Sorry, there is no counter to having an asteroid lobbed at you with a moments notice.
